[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rit-bikeshare/mobile-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rit-bikeshare/mobile-app)

This is the react native BikeShare mobile app.
It uses Expo for the build system which allows for surprisingly easy testing.

We also use travis to automatically build and publish new javascript versions as well as build and sign IOS and Android apps.
